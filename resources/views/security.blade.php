                        <img src="/_assets/pci-dss-compliant.gif" />
                        <p>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) has become one of the most important advances in the credit card industry and online security, and is now required by Visa/MasterCard for all merchants handling credit cards. Not following these rules can result in fines to the merchant and processing privileges being suspended.</p>
                        <p>All credit card data is stored encrypted, and cannot be decrypted-except during the process of transmitting a transaction.</p>
