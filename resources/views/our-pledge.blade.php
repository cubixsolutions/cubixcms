<p>If we have no choice but to pass your enquiry on to someone else we will tell you who will be dealing with it, and we will support you to get the help you need.</p>

<p>If your enquiry cannot be dealt with at the time you contact us we will make sure you know what is happening and when you can expect to receive further contact from us.</p>
